This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can also include code from other scripts:

```{r}
source("processData.R")
```

Example script that takes something from input and writes a png to output
```{r}
# read csv from input
data <- read.csv("input//data.csv")
# transform it using a sourced function
processedData <- doSomething(data)
# plot
png(filename = "output/image.png")
plot(processedData)
dev.off()
plot(processedData)
```

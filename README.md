# A workflow for reproducible and transparent data journalism with R and GitHub

This repo is tutorial & example at the same time, yay!

## Steps

### Step 0

Init an empty repository & and add remote:
```
mkdir reproducibility-workflow
cd reproducibility-workflow
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/srfdata/reproducibility-workflow.git (replace this with your account and repo, of course)
```

Add a .gitignore to ignore standard R output files & project files
```
.Rdata
.Rhistory
.Rprofile
*.html
output/*
```

### Step 1

All your "productive" R code goes into one RMarkdown file, but you can include source files (see `main.Rmd`).

You can work with your repo as you would with any other, doing stuff like
```
git add
git commit
git push
...
```

### Step 2

Now you want to publish your RMarkdown, and, ideally, your whole R script (together with the input file) on GitHub Pages. 

Initially, and only once, you need to do the following in your working directory:

1. Start a new branch gh-pages

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
```

2. remove everything 
```
git rm -rf .
```

3.. Add a .gitignore with stuff you don't want
```
.Rdata
.Rhistory
.Rprofile
main.html
output/*
tmp
```

4. make an initial commit as well as a push to GitHub
```
git commit -am "first commit to gh-pages branch"
```

### Step 3
For deployment, we want the following: 

* The knitted RMarkdown file (`main.html`) should be pushed as `Ã¬ndex.html`, so it is shown on the GitHub Page
* The R code and the input files should be made available for download as a zipped folder, so everyone can rerun the RMarkdown and/or modify the code and produce the output folder.

In order to automate the deployment process, we create a little deploy script.

First, make sure you are in the master branch
```
git checkout master
```

Then, fire up your favorite editor and create a shellscript `deploy.sh` in the top folder, with the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash
# make temporary copy of the stuff we want to commit in with all data we need in build
cp -r * tmp
# switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages
# copy over index file (the processed preprocessing.Rmd) from master branch
cp tmp/preprocessing.html index.html
# clean
rm -rf rscript/
mkdir rscript
# copy over necessary scripts from master branch 
cp tmp/classify.r rscript
cp tmp/numberFormatter.r rscript
cp tmp/preprocessing.Rmd rscript
mkdir rscript/output
# copy over other nessecary output files from master branch
cp tmp/output/verzeichnis_beschreibung.csv rscript/output/
cp tmp/output/signatures_verzeichnis_haupttyp_beschreibung.csv rscript/output/
# copy over other necessary input files from master branch
cp -r tmp/input rscript/
# zip the rscript folder
zip -r rscript.zip rscript
# remove the rscript folder
rm -rf rscript
# remove temporary folder
rm -rf tmp
# add everything for committing
git add .
git add -u
# commit in gh-pages
git commit -m "preprocessing: build and deploy to gh-pages"
# push to remote:gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages 
# checkout master again
git checkout master

```
At the end, make the script executable 
```
chmod 755 deploy.sh
```
